--Clean up telephone numbers
--The telephone numbers in the database are very inconsistently formatted. You'd like to print a list of member ids and numbers that have had '-','(',')', and ' ' characters removed. Order by member id.
SELECT memid, translate(telephone, '-() ', '') as telephone FROM cd.members
ORDER BY memid;
